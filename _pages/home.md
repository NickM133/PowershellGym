## Hello PowerShell enthusiasts!

After a bit of a rocky start on a less-than-reliable (Contabo...) VPS, PowerShellGym.com has found a new home here on GitHub Pages. Transitioning from WordPress to markdown and GitHub has been a somewhat of a learning curve, but definitely a step in the right direction towards less clutter and more stability. No more weekly Wordpress updates just for maintenance—now it’s all about the code and the content!

## What’s New?

Starting today, I’m shifting gears from weekly to daily PowerShell exercises. *Why daily?* It’s all about building a habit—60 days of continuous learning and scripting should do the trick! Each day, I’ll post a new challenge that I’ve taken on, the PowerShell script I’ve crafted in response, and my thought process behind it.

## Follow My Journey

You can follow my 60-day journey right here, where I'll be diving into different aspects of Powershell each week. Each week has a unique theme, allowing me to explore specific areas in depth:

### Week 1: Entra ID

- Day 1: [Entra ID User Management module - a module to create, update and delete Entra ID users, with error handling and logging](/2024-09-04-Entra-ID-User-Management-module)
- Day 2: 
- Day 3: 
- Day 4: 
- Day 5: 
- Day 6: 
- Day 7: 

### Week 2: Azure

- Day 8:
- Day 9:
- Day 10:
- Day 11:
- Day 12:
- Day 13:
- Day 14:

…and so forth until Week 9, I'll update this list everyday

## Why Do This?

This blog is not just about sharing what I learn but also about deepening my own understanding of PowerShell by teaching others. Each post is a step in my journey towards mastering PowerShell, and I invite you to join me in this challenge. Whether you’re here to learn, to critique, or just to see what one can do with PowerShell every day, welcome aboard!
